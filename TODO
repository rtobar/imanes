 * Change the way that the CPU addresses are read/written. For this I should
   have  a separate (inline?) method to do this.
   * Handle the mirroring this way, also for the PPU VRAM

 * Draw first sprites / background / last sprites in separate layers, and do a
   merge after that.
 * Add initial support for user input through (configurable?) keys
 * Fix *once for all* the background drawing
 * Fix the ADC/SBC instructions (recognize the C flag change)
