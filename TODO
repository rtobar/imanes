 * Change the way that the CPU addresses are read/written. For this I should
   have a separate (inline?) method to do this.
   * Handle the mirroring this way, also for the PPU VRAM
   * This could not be a good idea. For example, the PPU->SR is updated when
     you read on CPU's RAM 0x2000, so it could be a good idea to leave them
     totally separated.
 * Draw first sprites / background / last sprites in separate layers, and do
   a merge after that.
 * [DONE] Add initial support for user input through keyboard
  * Support second pad
 * Support user configuration for several thing
  * Keys
  * Video scaling
  * Verbosity
 * [TESTING] Fix *once for all* the background drawing
 * [TESTING] Fix sprite drawing (they seem to be 1 pixel above)
 * Fix the ADC/SBC instructions (recognize the C flag change)
 * [DONE] Add a pause option (using pthread_mutex I think...)
