 * [DONE] Change the way that the CPU addresses are read/written.
   For this I should have a separate (inline?) method to do this.
   * Handle the mirroring this way, also for the PPU VRAM
 * Draw first sprites / background / last sprites in separate layers, and do
   a merge after that.
 * [DONE] Add initial support for user input through keyboard
  * Support second pad
 * Support user configuration for several things
  * Keys
  * Video scaling
  * Verbosity
 * [TESTING] Fix *once for all* the background drawing
 * [TESTING] Fix sprite drawing (they seem to be 1 pixel above)
   * Testing is needed to check out the vertical flip feature
   * The "pixel 0 bit" should be recognized and set
 * Fix the ADC/SBC instructions (recognize the C flag change)
 * [DONE] Add a pause option (using pthread_mutex I think...)
