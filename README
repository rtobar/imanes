ImaNES v0.1
===========

Well, welcome to the ImaNES project. This project has started recently in an
effort to add some intelligence to the emulation of a NES game. The idea is,
that through the training of the machine, it could be capable of self-play the
game, in order to win without problems.

Anyways, the first goal of this project is to emulate a NES properly. With some
functionalities missing, it could be considered to emulate well a NES (for
example, the sound could be missing, but the user input not). Therefore, the
first version of ImaNES will be just an emulator, with the most basic things,
but future versions should have more improvements, in the emulation side, in the
intelligence side, and also on the user experience side.

Hope you enjoy ImaNES!


Compiling
=========

ImaNES has been developed under Linux, using the gcc compiler. SDL libraries on
your system should be enough to compile it without problems. To compile ImaNES
just do the following:

$> sh build.sh
$> ./configure
$> make all
$> make install

Check the INSTALL file for further details
